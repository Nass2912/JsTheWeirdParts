            Ever gotten a compile error on your terminal, be it react, vue or a simple script you've written. Thank this guy for it.
            It's basically a set of rules and strict commands ( specificities of a particular language for eg: ()=>{} to denote an arrow function ) which is run and checks on whether it is correct or not based on the language you're using.

            One thing to remember is what you write in code form is not what the computer reads. It is compiled and/or interpreted by programs called the compiler and interpreter which are themselves a series of rules and command wirtten by someone ( Grace Hopper being the first person to create a compiler) and turn your code to 0s and 1s
